# Traits
When you're prompted to input a pokemon species, you can input "x" to say "give me a random pokemon". You can add qualifiers to this, which will refine the possible results. For example, inputting "x[bodysize_large+cocksize_large]" will give you a random pokemon with a large body and large cock.

The symbol `+` will separate terms that must be matched in order for a pokemon to be considered. The symbol `;` can be used to create a list of traits where, if any of those traits match, the entire term matches. For example,

> x[cocksize_large;cocksize_huge;cocksize_colossal+bodysize_large;bodysize_huge]

translates to "(cocksize_large or cocksize_huge or cocksize_colossal) and (bodysize_large or bodysize_huge)". Again, separating traits with `;` allows any number of them to fail, as long as one matches.

This page is a reference doc for the traits that you can search for this way. I'll add traits for cock types and body types once I get a good plan for it.
